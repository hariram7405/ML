# Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A simple command-line game where the user competes against the computer in a **Rock, Paper, Scissors** match. The user enters their choice, and the computer randomly selects one of the three options. The game continues until either the user or the computer wins 3 rounds.

## Features

- **User Input**: The user can choose between:
  - 'r' for rock
  - 's' for scissors
  - 'p' for paper
- **Computer Choice**: The computer randomly selects one of the three choices.
- **Round Winner**: The round winner is determined based on the game rules:
  - Rock beats Scissors
  - Scissors beats Paper
  - Paper beats Rock
- **Score Tracking**: The game tracks scores for both the user and the computer. The first to reach 3 points wins the match.
- **Replay Option**: After each game, the user is prompted to play again. The overall win count is displayed, and the game ends when the user chooses not to continue.

## Notes

- The game is played until either the user or the computer reaches 3 wins.
- The game is case-insensitive for user input (e.g., 'r', 'R' are both valid for rock).
- Invalid inputs will prompt the user to enter a valid option.
- The program uses randomization for the computer's choice to ensure fairness.
